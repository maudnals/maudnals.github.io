# maudnals (Maud Nalpas)

Welcome to this GitHub README I use as a website. Because why not.

## Hi

I'm Maud. I'm a Developer Relations Engineer.
I specialize on security, privacy and identity on the web. I currently work at Google on the Chrome team. 

My _favorite_ things to work on are **web security** and **open-source demos and developer tools**. 

I have experience producing educational content for developers, speaking to and mingling with developer communities to listen to their ideas and channel their feedback to product teams, building tools and demos for developers, helping developers troubleshoot their issues.

## Areas I have experience with

### Languages / Frameworks

* JavaScript, TypeScript, node
* React, React native, a bit of Angular back in the day
* python

### Domains

* Web security: XSS and its mitigations (CSP, Trusted Types); Security headers in general
* Web privacy: private advertising techniques, privacy on the web, differential privacy techniques
* Web identity: WebAuthn, Passkeys

## Developer tools and demos I've built

* Lead on Noise Lab
* Various demos: [Referrer](https://site-one.glitch.me/stuff/detail?tag=blue), [Reporting API](link TBD), [xss](link TBD)

## More about me

My background is frontend / full-stack development. I've worked extensively with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and React native. I've also had a stint as a UX/UI designer.

I love my job when I get to:
* Serve the developer community;
* Build tools that improve developer experience;
* Author and deliver content (articles, videos, code/demos, conference talks) to guide people through adoption. I collaborate with Product Managers, Engineering teams, Designers and Customer Success teams;
* Collect developer feedback → Design solutions to address this feedback → Channel these proposals to the relevant product teams.

I live in Berlin, Germany. I'm fluent in English, French and German.
