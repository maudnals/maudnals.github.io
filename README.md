## Hi

Hi, I'm Maud. I'm a Developer Relations Engineer.

Aside from regular software engineering work, I have experience:
* Producing educational content for developers
* Building developer tools and demos

* Mingling with these communities to collect their pain points and ideas, design solutions, and channel these proposals to product teams
* Collaborating closely with Product Managers, Engineering teams, Design teams, and Customer Success teams.

### Languages / Frameworks

* JavaScript, TypeScript, nodeJS

* Some python
