I love my job when I get to:
* Serve the developer community;
* Build tools that improve developer experience;
* Author and deliver content (articles, videos, code/demos, conference talks) to guide people through adoption. I collaborate with Product Managers, Engineering teams, Designers and Customer Success teams;

I live in Berlin, Germany. I'm fluent in English, French and German.
