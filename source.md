# Hi, I'm Maud. 

I'm a **Developer Relations Engineer** at Google working on Chrome.

  <sup>How it all started! Qt/OpenGL with C++</sup>
</p>

I started coding with C++ in 2013 and was quickly drawn to the **web**.
Since 2015, I've built many web products using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, React, and React Native. I also had a stint as a **UX/UI designer**. 

I then moved onto Developer Relations Engineering.
I love being a **bridge between developers and product/eng teams**. I build developer tools, write demos and docs, run developer research, design dev tooling solutions, and channel feedback to product teams.
I also speak at conferences.

*Today, I focus on web security, privacy, authentication and AI.**

In the physical world, I live in Paris 🇫🇷. You can find me roaming around taking street pictures. Online, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maudnalpas/) (less so on [X](https://x.com/maudnals?lang=en)).
