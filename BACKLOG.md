## Hi

Hi, I'm Maud. I'm a Developer Relations Engineer.

I specialize in security, privacy and identity on the web. 
I currently work at Google on the Chrome team. 

My 🖤 **favorite** things to work on:
*  **Web security**
* **Demos**
* **(Open-source) developer tools and libraries** that enhance developer experience. 

My background is web / software development in a fullstack capacity, leaning towards frontend. I've worked extensively with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and React native. I've also had a stint as a UX/UI designer.

Aside from regular software engineering work, I have experience:
* Producing educational content for developers
* Building developer tools and demos
* Speaking to developer communities
* Mingling with these communities to collect their pain points and ideas, design solutions, and channel these proposals to product teams
* Collaborating closely with Product Managers, Engineering teams, Design teams, and Customer Success teams.

🔒 **Security**. XSS and its mitigations (CSP, Trusted Types), client-side web security attacks and mitigations.

🕵🏽 **Privacy**. Privacy on the web, third-parties, private advertising techniques, differential privacy techniques.

👤 **Authentication / Identity**. WebAuthn, Passkeys.
